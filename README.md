This project is my first "serious" attempt to make a good looking Flutter mobile app. The main aim is to see how far I can go having very little experience with Flutter.

I focused a lot on making the app look pretty âœ¨ and animated ðŸŽ¬ !

There are many features that are supposed to be added to the app as I go and learn new things.

I am really proud of how this app turned out to be ðŸ”¥, however there's still some issues I faced and some of them am still facing and trying to fix. Especially the fact that the app only support a very narrow range of screensizes ðŸ˜”!
